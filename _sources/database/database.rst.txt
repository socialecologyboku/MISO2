Database
========

The MAT_STOCKS database version 1.0 is derived from the MISO2 model, covering 23 raw materials, 20 of which are stock-building materials, and 13 detailed end-uses for 177 countries.
An aggregated version of the `MAT_STOCKS database version 1.0 <https://zenodo.org/records/12794253>`_ is directly available on Zenodo.

Figure 1 shows material stocks by end uses and materials, and figure 2 shows material stocks per capita around the world `(Wiedenhofer et al. 2024)  <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13575>`_.

   Figure 1: Global material stocks by end use and material.

**The MAT_STOCKS database provides:**

- Material stocks by four main end-uses: buildings, infrastructure, machinery and other short-lived products
- Material stocks and flows by four main material groupings: biomass, non-metallic minerals, metals, as well as fossil-fuels derived materials
- Flows: Gross Additions to Stocks and End-of-Life/Waste potentials
- All 177 countries
- 1900 to 2016

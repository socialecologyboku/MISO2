Input data===========MISO2 mostly uses the ODYM data scheme of .xls files to prepare its input data, using additional config files forfunctionality added by the MISO2 model.ODYM setup files----------------* **MISO2_Classifications_Master.xls**Contains the classification of elements, time, regions, materials and sectors.* **MISO2_Config.xls**Contains parameters and their description. ODYM uses this file to determine which further parameter xls to parse.* **MISO2_<parameter>_v<version>.xls**Contain the `values`, uncertainties (`values_uncert`) and `CV` for each parameter. Parameters created by automated workflowsalso have a `source` sheet which lists the origin of each datapoint.Additional files----------------* **MISO2_uncertainty_distribution_settings.xls**Contains the necessary parameters for setting and handling uncertainty within the MISO2 model and value range limits.Checks are run for minimum and maximum limit for parameter values, the type of (global) uncertainty distribution and the global estimateduncertainty value... note::    The type of distribution is mainly used as a preliminary check to determine if an allocation parameter is used.     For allocation parameters, the sum of individual values (e.g. sectors) must always add up to 1.* **MISO2_classification_properties.xls**Contain additional information for each classification properties, such as information on AggregateMultipliers permaterial.

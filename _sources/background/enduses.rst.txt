End-use product groups
======================

Materials accumulate as stocks in different ‘end-uses’. For MISO2, the novel ‘end-use transfer’ method building on Waste Input-Output
Analysis (EUT-WIO-MF) `(Streeck et al., 2023b) <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13379>`_, was applied and refined herein. We combine information from the GLORIA MRIO and physical shipment data, as well as materials-specific filter matrices to obtain 13
end-uses product groups (Figure 1). Further information can be found in `(Wiedenhofer et al. 2024)  <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13575>`_.
